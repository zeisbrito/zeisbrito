- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @zeisbrito, my name is MoisÃ©s. I'm from Brazil.
- Iâ€™m currently learning about HTML5, CSS3, JS and PHP based on Object-Oriented Programming, MVC structure, Data Access Object class. I'm studing that because I'm migrating to the development area and, based on my research, I think that is a good way to start learn.
- Iâ€™m interested in a lot of things of technology. In fact, I have a bachelor degree in electrical engineering and I like to much to play with embedded systems like Arduino, ESP32, 3D print, etc. Currently I'm finishing a personal DIY 3D print project based on a Prusa i3 model.
- So, I'm so excited to learn as much as possible.
- See ya!!!
