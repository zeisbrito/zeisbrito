- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @zeisbrito, my name is MoisÃ©s. I'm from Brazil.
- Iâ€™m interested in a lot of things, in fact I'm electrical engineer. I like to much to play with embedded systems like Arduino, ESP32, etc.
- Iâ€™m currently learning HTML5, CSS3 and JS because I'm migrating to the development area and based on my research I think that is a good way to start learn.
- So, I'm so excited to learn as much as possible.
- See ya!!!
